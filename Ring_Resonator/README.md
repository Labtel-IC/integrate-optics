# integrate-optics
This repository will be used for developing coding in different software for creating and testing optical devices that will be used integrated with electronic circuits.

This is a first draft, later on this file will be modified to better explaing the projects here under development.

It is important to add the "matlab_tools" folder to the path directory of your matlabt for the codes here to proper work.
